# Logistic regression Project

Welcome! This is new project and new tasks at hand. 

**This is Logistic Regression Project**

We are going to do task to strengthen whatever we learned in class of Logistic Regression. 

# What we have learned so far:
- Why Logistic Regression and What is Logistic Regression?
- Hypertuning Parameter
- Gradient Descent 
- Evaluation metrics of Logistic Regression

### Dataset
To perform Logistic Regression task we will use `Loan Prediction` dataset.  

This dataset contains following features: 
- Applications Numbers that came
- Co-application
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount term
- Credit History
- Loan Status 

**Target Variable:**
- Loan Status

# What we are going to do?
* You have above data-set. You need to clean this data first.
* After cleaning, you will create a logistic regression model and fit that model on the data.

**Details information is mentioned in each task.**

## By completing this task you will be earning 250 points in you training. So, GOOD LUCK!
